# Aeroscript

- Domain-specific language (DLS) to program flight patterns for drones

- The language consists of instructions for programming drones to carry out missions (so-called missions), with instructions for flying straight ahead, up, down, turning left or right, bypassing obstacles, dealing with low battery, etc.

- The programming environment consists of lexer, parser, for concrete syntax, abstract syntax with static analysis, and a interpret to simulate flights. 
- Used Gradle for build, test, and deployment
